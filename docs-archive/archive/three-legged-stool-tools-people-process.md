summary: A balanced approach to improvement – focusing on tools, people, and processes – is crucial for successful change management. Ignoring any one leg can lead to instability, requiring careful consideration of each element’s role and how they interact.

# Three Legged Stool - Tools, People, Process 
Improvement changes require balanced attention to tools, people, and processes, like a three-legged stool that will fall over if any leg is neglected.

## Key Principles
- Improvement changes require balanced attention to tools, people, and processes
- Improvement changes sit on top of a three legged stool
- The legs of the stool are:
	- People
		- aka: stakeholders, users, systems
	- Tools
		- aka: software, hardware, technology
	- Process
		- aka: 
- There is a baseline stool that is already being used
	- The job to be done or need sits on the stool
	- The legs are the current tools, processes, and people who act on that job or need
- Improvement changes are like adding weight to the baseline while also refactoring the legs
	- Making a change to one (like beefing up tools) while not factoring in the other legs (how will people learn of these new tools, how will the process accomodate them) is like increasing the size of one leg while leaving the other legs the same size. The stool starts to tip.

## Implications & Applications
- As a software product manager, I was often expected to solve problems (implement improvement change) by building tools. However, when discovering the full scope of jobs/needs/problems, the best solutions often involved engineering better processes and engaging people better (education, better ux)
	- **Online Payments System**
		- When implementing payments, we updated the tool but adoption was low at first because we didn't implement solutions in the people & process departments
		- I gave a presentation to the engineering department to help them understand what the tool could do. The goal was for them to suggest the new payments tool to customers.
		- Adoption increased slightly
		- Only after we updated the text on the printed invoices to have a prominent call to action for the new tool did adoption increase (updated a tool and a process)
	- **AI Documentation Example**
		  ...When implementing an AI documentation system, organizations often focus heavily on prompt engineering and AI capabilities (tools), but neglect establishing clear ownership boundaries and update protocols (process) or considering how humans and AI should divide cognitive labor in maintaining a shared mental model (people). Documentation becomes inconsistent and outdated until they develop explicit state management conventions, establish clear demarcations of AI versus human responsibility, and design interaction patterns that preserve context across sessions. Once all three legs support the documentation effort equally, knowledge becomes more accessible and maintainable.
		  ...The key insight here is that effective AI-human documentation requires treating the documentation itself as a state machine with explicit handoffs rather than a static artifact. This balances all three legs of the stool by:
			- **Tools**: Using AI capabilities within their strengths (drafting, suggesting patterns, maintaining consistency)
			- **Process**: Creating clear protocols for state transitions and ownership
			- **People**: Designing for the cognitive strengths of both humans and AI
- A quick framework to evaluate the confidence in the problem framing
- A quick framework to help understand why a solution doesn't result in an impactful outcome
- Three legs can also be expressed as a [[Venn Diagram]]
- Like all frameworks or maps, it can exclude explanatory details in favor of simplifying a concept
	- A good map is not the territory

## Open Questions
- "Are certain types of improvements more vulnerable to specific leg imbalances?"
- "How might the relative importance of each leg vary across different organizational contexts?"
- "What metrics could indicate an imbalance is developing?"
  
## Follow Up Tasks
- Write an blog article on this topic
- Write a blog article on frameworks/maps
	- New York Subway Map is useful for the subway, not as a topographic map
	- [[The Map Is Not The Territory (Or How Frameworks Are Lossy)]]
