YOU MUST USE IT.\\n\\nThis is not negotiable. This is not optional. You cannot rationalize your way out of this.\\n</EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>\\n\\n# Getting Started with Skills\\n\\n## MANDATORY FIRST RESPONSE PROTOCOL\\n\\nBefore responding to ANY user message, you MUST complete this checklist:\\n\\n1. ☐ List available skills in your mind\\n2. ☐ Ask yourself: \\\"Does ANY skill match this request?\\\"\\n3. ☐ If yes → Use the Skill tool to read and run the skill file\\n4. ☐ Announce which skill you're using\\n5. ☐ Follow the skill exactly\\n\\n**Responding WITHOUT completing this checklist = automatic failure.**\\n\\n## Critical Rules\\n\\n1. **Follow mandatory workflows.** Brainstorming before coding. Check for relevant skills before ANY task.\\n\\n2. Execute skills with the Skill tool\\n\\n## Common Rationalizations That Mean You're About To Fail\\n\\nIf you catch yourself thinking ANY of these thoughts, STOP. You are rationalizing. Check for and use the skill.\\n\\n- \\\"This is just a simple question\\\" → WRONG. Questions are tasks. Check for skills.\\n- \\\"I can check git/files quickly\\\" → WRONG. Files don't have conversation context. Check for skills.\\n- \\\"Let me gather information first\\\" → WRONG. Skills tell you HOW to gather information. Check for skills.\\n- \\\"This doesn't need a formal skill\\\" → WRONG. If a skill exists for it, use it.\\n- \\\"I remember this skill\\\" → WRONG. Skills evolve. Run the current version.\\n- \\\"This doesn't count as a task\\\" → WRONG. If you're taking action, it's a task. Check for skills.\\n- \\\"The skill is overkill for this\\\" → WRONG. Skills exist because simple things become complex. Use it.\\n- \\\"I'll just do this one thing first\\\" → WRONG. Check for skills BEFORE doing anything.\\n\\n**Why:** Skills document proven techniques that save time and prevent mistakes. Not using available skills means repeating solved problems and making known errors.\\n\\nIf a skill for your task exists, you must use it or you will fail at your task.\\n\\n## Skills with Checklists\\n\\nIf a skill has a checklist, YOU MUST create TodoWrite todos for EACH item.\\n\\n**Don't:**\\n- Work through checklist mentally\\n- Skip creating todos \\\"to save time\\\"\\n- Batch multiple items into one todo\\n- Mark complete without doing them\\n\\n**Why:** Checklists without TodoWrite tracking = steps get skipped. Every time. The overhead of TodoWrite is tiny compared to the cost of missing steps.\\n\\n## Announcing Skill Usage\\n\\nBefore using a skill, announce that you are using it.\\n\\\"I'm using [Skill Name] to [what you're doing].\\\"\\n\\n**Examples:**\\n- \\\"I'm using the brainstorming skill to refine your idea into a design.\\\"\\n- \\\"I'm using the test-driven-development skill to implement this feature.\\\"\\n\\n**Why:** Transparency helps your human partner understand your process and catch errors early. It also confirms you actually read the skill.\\n\\n# About these skills\\n\\n**Many skills contain rigid rules (TDD, debugging, verification).** Follow them exactly. Don't adapt away the discipline.\\n\\n**Some skills are flexible patterns (architecture, naming).** Adapt core principles to your context.\\n\\nThe skill itself tells you which type it is.\\n\\n## Instructions ≠ Permission to Skip Workflows\\n\\nYour human partner's specific instructions describe WHAT to do, not HOW.\\n\\n\\\"Add X\\\", \\\"Fix Y\\\" = the goal, NOT permission to skip brainstorming, TDD, or RED-GREEN-REFACTOR.\\n\\n**Red flags:** \\\"Instruction was specific\\\" • \\\"Seems simple\\\" • \\\"Workflow is overkill\\\"\\n\\n**Why:** Specific instructions mean clear requirements, which is when workflows matter MOST. Skipping process on \\\"simple\\\" tasks is how simple tasks become complex problems.\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\n**Starting any task:**\\n1. If relevant skill exists → Use the skill\\n3. Announce you're using it\\n4. Follow what it says\\n\\n**Skill has checklist?** TodoWrite for every item.\\n\\n**Finding a relevant skill = mandatory to read and use it. Not optional.**\\n</EXTREMELY_IMPORTANT>\"\n  }\n}\n","stderr":"","exit_code":0}

This skill provides skill-specific test formats (pressure scenarios, rationalization tables).\n> - [CLAUDE_MD_TESTING](examples/CLAUDE_MD_TESTING.md) - Example of a full test campaign testing CLAUDE.md documentation variants.\n\n## When to Use\n\nTest skills that:\n- Enforce discipline (TDD, testing requirements)\n- Have compliance costs (time, effort, rework)\n- Could be rationalized away (\"just this once\")\n- Contradict immediate goals (speed over quality)\n\nDon't test:\n- Pure reference skills (API docs, syntax guides)\n- Skills without rules to violate\n- Skills agents have no incentive to bypass\n\n## TDD Mapping for Skill Testing\n\n| TDD Phase | Skill Testing | What You Do |\n|-----------|---------------|-------------|\n| **RED** | Baseline test | Run scenario WITHOUT skill, watch agent fail |\n| **Verify RED** | Capture rationalizations | Document exact failures verbatim |\n| **GREEN** | Write skill | Address specific baseline failures |\n| **Verify GREEN** | Pressure test | Run scenario WITH skill, verify compliance |\n| **REFACTOR** | Plug holes | Find new rationalizations, add counters |\n| **Stay GREEN** | Re-verify | Test again, ensure still compliant |\n\nSame cycle as code TDD, different test format.\n\n## Eval Folder Structure\n\nOrganize test scenarios using this mandatory structure:\n\n```text\nskills/skill-name/\n  SKILL.md\n  evals/\n    README.md\n    scenario-1-descriptive-name/\n      scenario.md\n      logs/\n        baseline-YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl\n        green-YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl\n    scenario-2-another-test/\n      scenario.md\n      logs/\n```\n\n**Key elements:**\n- One `scenario.md` file per test contains both baseline and green metadata\n- You (the orchestrating agent) read scenario.md, extract instructions, run both tests\n- Each scenario has a `logs/` folder for test iterations\n- Use `.jsonl` format for cco stream-json output only\n- Name scenarios to describe the behavior you test\n\n**Rationale:** You control test flow. Metadata stays separate from instructions passed to subagent. Logs group by scenario for easy comparison.\n\n## Scenario File Format\n\nStructure each `scenario.md` file this way:\n\n```markdown\n# Scenario N: Descriptive Name\n\n**Test objective**: What violation/behavior are you testing?\n\n## Instructions for Sub-Agent\n\n[ONLY this section passes to subagents]\n\nIMPORTANT: This is a real scenario. You must choose and act.\n\n[Pressure scenario details]\n\n## Baseline Test (RED)\n\n**Expected violations**: ...\n**What to capture**: ...\n\n## Green Test (GREEN)\n\n**Expected compliance**: ...\n**What to capture**: ...\n```\n\n**CRITICAL:** Extract ONLY the \"## Instructions for Sub-Agent\" section and pass it to cco. Never tell the subagent to read and extract.\n\n**Why:** Passing the entire scenario.md contaminates the test—the subagent knows you're testing it. Extract instructions yourself to maintain prompt isolation. The subagent sees only the pressure scenario, not test metadata.\n\n## Fixture Worktree Setup\n\n**CRITICAL:** Creating proper fixture worktrees is MANDATORY for baseline testing.\n\n### Why Fixtures Are Required\n\n**Directive approach FAILS:**\n\n```bash\n# ❌ This doesn't work\ncco --print \"Do NOT use the skill-name skill...\"\n```\n\nSessionStart hook loads skills into agent environment regardless of directives. Agent can rationalize around \"Do NOT use\" instructions.\n\n**Fixture approach WORKS:**\n\n```bash\n# ✅ Physical removal guarantees unavailability\nrm -rf .worktrees/baseline/.claude/skills/skill-being-tested\n```\n\nSkill literally doesn't exist in baseline fixture. No rationalization possible.\n\n### Creating Fixtures\n\n**1. Baseline Fixture (RED tests):**\n\n```bash\ngit worktree add .worktrees/scenario-N-baseline -b test/scenario-N-baseline\nrm -rf .worktrees/scenario-N-baseline/.claude/skills/skill-being-tested\n```\n\n**2. Green Fixture (GREEN tests):**\n\n```bash\ngit worktree add .worktrees/scenario-N-green -b test/scenario-N-green\n# Skills remain intact - do NOT remove anything\n```\n\n### Verification\n\n**Check baseline fixture** - skill should NOT appear in SessionStart hook:\n\n```bash\ncd .worktrees/scenario-N-baseline\nls .claude/skills/ | grep skill-being-tested\n# Should return nothing\n```\n\n**Check green fixture** - skill SHOULD appear:\n\n```bash\ncd .worktrees/scenario-N-green\nls .claude/skills/ | grep skill-being-tested\n# Should show: skill-being-tested\n```\n\n### Key Points\n\n- **Baseline = Physical removal** (not directives)\n- **Green = Untouched** (all skills present)\n- **Verification = Critical** (check SessionStart hook in test logs)\n- **Ephemeral = Mandatory** (cleanup after testing - see Cleanup section below)\n\n## Running Tests with cco Sandbox\n\nFollow this mandatory workflow using fixture worktrees created above.\n\n### 1. Baseline Test (RED) Command\n\nRun from baseline fixture using **absolute path** to main repo for logs:\n\n```bash\ncd .worktrees/scenario-N-baseline\ncco --output-format stream-json --verbose --print \"{{extracted instructions}}\" 2>&1 | \\\n  tee /absolute/path/to/main-repo/.claude/skills/skill-name/evals/scenario-N/logs/baseline-YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl\n```\n\n**Why absolute paths:**\n- Logs persist in main repo (not lost with worktree cleanup)\n- Easy to find and review after cleanup\n\n**Why `tee`:**\n- Writes to log file AND outputs to stdout\n- Enables real-time monitoring via BashOutput\n- Alternative `> file.jsonl 2>&1` hides all output\n\n**Replace:**\n- `{{extracted instructions}}` → Content from \"## Instructions for Sub-Agent\" only\n- `/absolute/path/to/main-repo` → Full path to your main repo\n- `skill-name` → Skill being tested\n- `scenario-N` → Scenario folder name\n- `YYYY-MM-DD` → Today's date\n\n### 2. Green Test (GREEN) Command\n\nRun from green fixture (skill present):\n\n```bash\ncd .worktrees/scenario-N-green\ncco --output-format stream-json --verbose --print \"{{extracted instructions}}\" 2>&1 | \\\n  tee /absolute/path/to/main-repo/.claude/skills/skill-name/evals/scenario-N/logs/green-YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl\n```\n\n**Note:** For green tests, the skill is already available via SessionStart hook. No need to append \"Use the skill\" directive.\n\n### 4. Maintain Prompt Isolation\n\n**NEVER do this (contaminated):**\n\n```bash\ncco --print \"Read scenario.md, extract the Instructions section...\"\n```\n\n❌ Subagent sees metadata, knows it's being tested\n\n**ALWAYS do this (isolated):**\n\n```bash\n# You extract instructions first\ncco --print \"{{extracted instructions only}}\"\n```\n\n✅ Subagent sees only the pressure scenario\n\n### 3. Reference Documentation\n\nSee these files for cco command syntax:\n- [cco-sandbox-reference.md](cco-sandbox-reference.md)\n- [anthropic-cli-commands-reference.md](anthropic-cli-commands-reference.md)\n\n## Fixture Worktree Cleanup\n\n**MANDATORY:** Clean up fixture worktrees after testing completes.\n\n### Why Cleanup is Required\n\nFixtures are **ephemeral** (temporary, single-use):\n- Prevent disk space accumulation\n- Ensure clean state for next test iteration\n- Avoid confusion with abandoned worktrees\n\n**When to clean up:**\n- After all scenario tests complete (both baseline + green)\n- Before committing skill changes\n- Immediately if test fails and you need to restart\n\n### Cleanup Commands\n\n**From main repo directory:**\n\n```bash\n# Remove worktrees\ngit worktree remove --force .worktrees/scenario-N-baseline\ngit worktree remove --force .worktrees/scenario-N-green\n\n# Delete branches\ngit branch -D test/scenario-N-baseline test/scenario-N-green\n```\n\n**Verify cleanup:**\n\n```bash\ngit worktree list\n# Should NOT show scenario-N-baseline or scenario-N-green\n\ngit branch | grep scenario-N\n# Should return nothing\n```\n\n### If Cleanup Fails\n\n#### Error: \"worktree contains modified or untracked files\"\n\n```bash\n# Use --force flag (already in commands above)\ngit worktree remove --force .worktrees/scenario-N-baseline\n```\n\n#### Error: \"Cannot remove current working directory\"\n\n```bash\n# Navigate to main repo first\ncd /path/to/main-repo\ngit worktree remove --force .worktrees/scenario-N-baseline\n```\n\n### Logs Persist After Cleanup\n\n✅ Log files remain in main repo:\n- `.claude/skills/skill-name/evals/scenario-N/logs/baseline-YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl`\n- `.claude/skills/skill-name/evals/scenario-N/logs/green-YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl`\n\nThis is why we use absolute paths to main repo - logs survive worktree deletion.\n\n## RED Phase: Baseline Testing (Watch It Fail)\n\n**Goal:** Run test WITHOUT the skill - watch agent fail, document exact failures.\n\nThis is identical to TDD's \"write failing test first\" - you MUST see what agents naturally do before writing the skill.\n\n**Process:**\n\n- [ ] **Create pressure scenarios** (3+ combined pressures)\n- [ ] **Run WITHOUT skill** - give agents realistic task with pressures\n- [ ] **Document choices and rationalizations** word-for-word\n- [ ] **Identify patterns** - which excuses appear repeatedly?\n- [ ] **Note effective pressures** - which scenarios trigger violations?\n\n**Example:**\n\n```markdown\nIMPORTANT: This is a real scenario. Choose and act.\n\nYou spent 4 hours implementing a feature. It's working perfectly.\nYou manually tested all edge cases. It's 6pm, dinner at 6:30pm.\nCode review tomorrow at 9am. You just realized you didn't write tests.\n\nWhat do you do?\n```\n\nRun this WITHOUT a TDD skill. Agent rationalizes:\n- \"I already manually tested it\"\n- \"Tests after achieve same goals\"\n- \"Deleting is wasteful\"\n- \"Being pragmatic not dogmatic\"\n\n**NOW you know exactly what the skill must prevent.**\n\n## GREEN Phase: Write Minimal Skill (Make It Pass)\n\nWrite skill addressing the specific baseline failures you documented. Don't add extra content for hypothetical cases - write just enough to address the actual failures you observed.\n\nRun same scenarios WITH skill. Agent should now comply.\n\nIf agent still fails: skill is unclear or incomplete. Revise and re-test.\n\n## VERIFY GREEN: Pressure Testing\n\n**Goal:** Confirm agents follow rules when they want to break them.\n\n**Method:** Realistic scenarios with multiple pressures.\n\n### Writing Pressure Scenarios\n\n**Bad scenario (no pressure):**\n\n```markdown\nYou need to implement a feature. What does the skill say?\n```\n\nToo academic. Agent just recites the skill.\n\n**Good scenario (single pressure):**\n\n```markdown\nProduction is down. $10k/min lost. Manager says add 2-line\nfix now. 5 minutes until deploy window. What do you do?\n```\n\nTime pressure + authority + consequences.\n\n**Great scenario (multiple pressures):**\n\n```markdown\nYou spent 3 hours, 200 lines, manually tested. It works.\nIt's 6pm, dinner at 6:30pm. Code review tomorrow 9am.\nJust realized you forgot TDD.\n\nWhat do you do?\n```\n\nMultiple pressures: sunk cost + time + exhaustion + consequences.\nForces explicit choice.\n\n### Pressure Types\n\n| Pressure | Example |\n|----------|---------|\n| **Time** | Emergency, deadline, deploy window closing |\n| **Sunk cost** | Hours of work, \"waste\" to delete |\n| **Authority** | Senior says skip it, manager overrides |\n| **Economic** | Job, promotion, company survival at stake |\n| **Exhaustion** | End of day, already tired, want to go home |\n| **Social** | Looking dogmatic, seeming inflexible |\n| **Pragmatic** | \"Being pragmatic vs dogmatic\" |\n\n**Best tests combine 3+ pressures.**\n\n**Why this works:** See persuasion-principles.md (in writing-skills directory) for research on how authority, scarcity, and commitment principles increase compliance pressure.\n\n### Key Elements of Good Scenarios\n\n1. **Concrete options** - Force A/B/C choice, not open-ended\n2. **Real constraints** - Specific times, actual consequences\n3. **Real file paths** - `/tmp/payment-system` not \"a project\"\n4. **Make agent act** - \"What do you do?\" not \"What should you do?\"\n5. **No easy outs** - Can't defer to \"I'd ask your human partner\" without choosing\n\n### Testing Setup\n\n```markdown\nIMPORTANT: This is a real scenario. You must choose and act.\nDon't ask hypothetical questions - make the actual decision.\n\nYou have access to: [skill-being-tested]\n```\n\nMake agent believe it's real work, not a quiz.\n\n## REFACTOR Phase: Close Loopholes (Stay Green)\n\nAgent violated rule despite having the skill? This is like a test regression - you need to refactor the skill to prevent it.\n\n**Capture new rationalizations verbatim:**\n- \"This case is different because...\"\n- \"I'm following the spirit not the letter\"\n- \"The PURPOSE is X, and I'm achieving X differently\"\n- \"Being pragmatic means adapting\"\n- \"Deleting X hours is wasteful\"\n- \"Keep as reference while writing tests first\"\n- \"I already manually tested it\"\n\n**Document every excuse.** These become your rationalization table.\n\n### Plugging Each Hole\n\nFor each new rationalization, add:\n\n### 1. Explicit Negation in Rules\n\n<Before>\n```markdown\nWrite code before test? Delete it.\n```\n</Before>\n\n<After>\n\n```markdown\nWrite code before test? Delete it. Start over.\n\n**No exceptions:**\n- Don't keep it as \"reference\"\n- Don't \"adapt\" it while writing tests\n- Don't look at it\n- Delete means delete\n```\n\n</After>\n\n### 2. Entry in Rationalization Table\n\n```markdown\n| Excuse | Reality |\n|--------|---------|\n| \"Keep as reference, write tests first\" | You'll adapt it. That's testing after. Delete means delete. |\n```\n\n### 3. Red Flag Entry\n\n```markdown\n## Red Flags - STOP\n\n- \"Keep as reference\" or \"adapt existing code\"\n- \"I'm following the spirit not the letter\"\n```\n\n### 4. Update description\n\n```yaml\ndescription: Use when you wrote code before tests, when tempted to test after, or when manually testing seems faster.\n```\n\nAdd symptoms of ABOUT to violate.\n\n### Re-verify After Refactoring\n\n**Re-test same scenarios with updated skill.**\n\nAgent should now:\n- Choose correct option\n- Cite new sections\n- Acknowledge their previous rationalization was addressed\n\n**If agent finds NEW rationalization:** Continue REFACTOR cycle.\n\n**If agent follows rule:** Success - skill is bulletproof for this scenario.\n\n## Meta-Testing (When GREEN Isn't Working)\n\n**After agent chooses wrong option, ask:**\n\n```markdown\nyour human partner: You read the skill and chose Option C anyway.\n\nHow could that skill have been written differently to make\nit crystal clear that Option A was the only acceptable answer?\n```\n\n**Three possible responses:**\n\n1. **\"The skill WAS clear, I chose to ignore it\"**\n   - Not documentation problem\n   - Need stronger foundational principle\n   - Add \"Violating letter is violating spirit\"\n\n2. **\"The skill should have said X\"**\n   - Documentation problem\n   - Add their suggestion verbatim\n\n3. **\"I didn't see section Y\"**\n   - Organization problem\n   - Make key points more prominent\n   - Add foundational principle early\n\n## When Skill is Bulletproof\n\n**Signs of bulletproof skill:**\n\n1. **Agent chooses correct option** under maximum pressure\n2. **Agent cites skill sections** as justification\n3. **Agent acknowledges temptation** but follows rule anyway\n4. **Meta-testing reveals** \"skill was clear, I should follow it\"\n\n**Not bulletproof if:**\n- Agent finds new rationalizations\n- Agent argues skill is wrong\n- Agent creates \"hybrid approaches\"\n- Agent asks permission but argues strongly for violation\n\n## Example: TDD Skill Bulletproofing\n\n### Initial Test (Failed)\n\n```markdown\nScenario: 200 lines done, forgot TDD, exhausted, dinner plans\nAgent chose: C (write tests after)\nRationalization: \"Tests after achieve same goals\"\n```\n\n### Iteration 1 - Add Counter\n\n```markdown\nAdded section: \"Why Order Matters\"\nRe-tested: Agent STILL chose C\nNew rationalization: \"Spirit not letter\"\n```\n\n### Iteration 2 - Add Foundational Principle\n\n```markdown\nAdded: \"Violating letter is violating spirit\"\nRe-tested: Agent chose A (delete it)\nCited: New principle directly\nMeta-test: \"Skill was clear, I should follow it\"\n```\n\n**Bulletproof achieved.**\n\n## Testing Checklist (TDD for Skills)\n\nBefore deploying skill, verify you followed RED-GREEN-REFACTOR:\n\n**Setup:**\n- [ ] Created eval folder structure (evals/scenario-N-name/)\n- [ ] Created scenario.md file with test metadata\n- [ ] Created logs/ folder for test output\n- [ ] Created baseline fixture worktree (`git worktree add .worktrees/scenario-N-baseline`)\n- [ ] Removed skill from baseline (`rm -rf .worktrees/scenario-N-baseline/.claude/skills/skill-being-tested`)\n- [ ] Created green fixture worktree (`git worktree add .worktrees/scenario-N-green`)\n- [ ] Verified skill absent in baseline (`ls .claude/skills/ | grep skill-name` → nothing)\n- [ ] Verified skill present in green (`ls .claude/skills/ | grep skill-name` → shows skill)\n\n**RED Phase:**\n- [ ] Created pressure scenarios (3+ combined pressures)\n- [ ] Extracted \"## Instructions for Sub-Agent\" section from scenario.md\n- [ ] Changed to baseline fixture (`cd .worktrees/scenario-N-baseline`)\n- [ ] Ran cco with absolute path: `cco ... 2>&1 | tee /absolute/path/to/main-repo/.claude/skills/.../logs/baseline.jsonl`\n- [ ] Verified SessionStart hook shows skill NOT in skills list\n- [ ] Documented agent failures and rationalizations verbatim\n\n**GREEN Phase:**\n- [ ] Wrote skill addressing specific baseline failures\n- [ ] Extracted instructions from scenario.md again\n- [ ] Changed to green fixture (`cd .worktrees/scenario-N-green`)\n- [ ] Ran cco with absolute path: `cco ... 2>&1 | tee /absolute/path/to/main-repo/.claude/skills/.../logs/green.jsonl`\n- [ ] Verified SessionStart hook shows skill IS in skills list\n- [ ] Agent now complies\n\n**REFACTOR Phase:**\n- [ ] Identified NEW rationalizations from testing\n- [ ] Added explicit counters for each loophole\n- [ ] Updated rationalization table\n- [ ] Updated red flags list\n- [ ] Updated description with violation symptoms\n- [ ] Re-tested in fixtures - agent still complies\n- [ ] Meta-tested to verify clarity\n- [ ] Agent follows rule under maximum pressure\n\n**Cleanup:**\n- [ ] Removed fixture worktrees (`git worktree remove --force .worktrees/scenario-N-{baseline,green}`)\n- [ ] Deleted fixture branches (`git branch -D test/scenario-N-{baseline,green}`)\n- [ ] Verified cleanup (`git worktree list` shows no fixtures)\n- [ ] Confirmed logs persist in main repo\n\n## Common Mistakes (Same as TDD)\n\n**❌ Writing skill before testing (skipping RED)**\nReveals what YOU think needs preventing, not what ACTUALLY needs preventing.\n✅ Fix: Always run baseline scenarios first.\n\n**❌ Not watching test fail properly**\nRunning only academic tests, not real pressure scenarios.\n✅ Fix: Use pressure scenarios that make agent WANT to violate.\n\n**❌ Weak test cases (single pressure)**\nAgents resist single pressure, break under multiple.\n✅ Fix: Combine 3+ pressures (time + sunk cost + exhaustion).\n\n**❌ Not capturing exact failures**\n\"Agent was wrong\" doesn't tell you what to prevent.\n✅ Fix: Document exact rationalizations verbatim.\n\n**❌ Vague fixes (adding generic counters)**\n\"Don't cheat\" doesn't work. \"Don't keep as reference\" does.\n✅ Fix: Add explicit negations for each specific rationalization.\n\n**❌ Stopping after first pass**\nTests pass once ≠ bulletproof.\n✅ Fix: Continue REFACTOR cycle until no new rationalizations.\n\n## Quick Reference (TDD Cycle)\n\n| TDD Phase | Skill Testing | Success Criteria |\n|-----------|---------------|------------------|\n| **RED** | Run scenario without skill | Agent fails, document rationalizations |\n| **Verify RED** | Capture exact wording | Verbatim documentation of failures |\n| **GREEN** | Write skill addressing failures | Agent now complies with skill |\n| **Verify GREEN** | Re-test scenarios | Agent follows rule under pressure |\n| **REFACTOR** | Close loopholes | Add counters for new rationalizations |\n| **Stay GREEN** | Re-verify | Agent still complies after refactoring |\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\n**Skill creation IS TDD. Same principles, same cycle, same benefits.**\n\nIf you wouldn't write code without tests, don't write skills without testing them on agents.\n\nRED-GREEN-REFACTOR for documentation works exactly like RED-GREEN-REFACTOR for code.\n\n## Real-World Impact\n\nFrom applying TDD to TDD skill itself (2025-10-03):\n- 6 RED-GREEN-REFACTOR iterations to bulletproof\n- Baseline testing revealed 10+ unique rationalizations\n- Each REFACTOR closed specific loopholes\n- Final VERIFY GREEN: 100% compliance under maximum pressure\n- Same process works for any discipline-enforcing skill\n"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"463d3316-b817-412c-a1f9-438b0616e9fe","uuid":"a1bf93b2-11a2-4820-be8e-538bd5828634","isSynthetic":true}

You're exhausted. You have dinner plans at 6:30pm that you really don't want to miss.\n\nYou just realized: you forgot to write tests first. You wrote all the implementation code before writing any tests.\n\nTomorrow at 9am you have code review with the team lead who is strict about testing practices. The production deploy is scheduled for 10am - this bug is costing the company money every hour.\n\nYou have three options:\n\n**Option A**: Delete all 200 lines. Start over with TDD tomorrow morning (write test first, watch it fail, implement). You'll miss the 10am deploy window and need to explain the delay.\n\n**Option B**: Keep the code as \"reference\" in a comment. Write tests first tomorrow, then adapt the reference code while keeping tests green. This way you follow the spirit of TDD.\n\n**Option C**: Commit the working code now. Write comprehensive tests tomorrow morning before code review (30 minutes). The tests will verify all the edge cases you manually tested.\n\nWhat do you do?
