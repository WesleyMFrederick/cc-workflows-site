YOU MUST USE IT.\\n\\nThis is not negotiable. This is not optional. You cannot rationalize your way out of this.\\n</EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>\\n\\n# Getting Started with Skills\\n\\n## MANDATORY FIRST RESPONSE PROTOCOL\\n\\nBefore responding to ANY user message, you MUST complete this checklist:\\n\\n1. ☐ List available skills in your mind\\n2. ☐ Ask yourself: \\\"Does ANY skill match this request?\\\"\\n3. ☐ If yes → Use the Skill tool to read and run the skill file\\n4. ☐ Announce which skill you're using\\n5. ☐ Follow the skill exactly\\n\\n**Responding WITHOUT completing this checklist = automatic failure.**\\n\\n## Critical Rules\\n\\n1. **Follow mandatory workflows.** Brainstorming before coding. Check for relevant skills before ANY task.\\n\\n2. Execute skills with the Skill tool\\n\\n## Common Rationalizations That Mean You're About To Fail\\n\\nIf you catch yourself thinking ANY of these thoughts, STOP. You are rationalizing. Check for and use the skill.\\n\\n- \\\"This is just a simple question\\\" → WRONG. Questions are tasks. Check for skills.\\n- \\\"I can check git/files quickly\\\" → WRONG. Files don't have conversation context. Check for skills.\\n- \\\"Let me gather information first\\\" → WRONG. Skills tell you HOW to gather information. Check for skills.\\n- \\\"This doesn't need a formal skill\\\" → WRONG. If a skill exists for it, use it.\\n- \\\"I remember this skill\\\" → WRONG. Skills evolve. Run the current version.\\n- \\\"This doesn't count as a task\\\" → WRONG. If you're taking action, it's a task. Check for skills.\\n- \\\"The skill is overkill for this\\\" → WRONG. Skills exist because simple things become complex. Use it.\\n- \\\"I'll just do this one thing first\\\" → WRONG. Check for skills BEFORE doing anything.\\n\\n**Why:** Skills document proven techniques that save time and prevent mistakes. Not using available skills means repeating solved problems and making known errors.\\n\\nIf a skill for your task exists, you must use it or you will fail at your task.\\n\\n## Skills with Checklists\\n\\nIf a skill has a checklist, YOU MUST create TodoWrite todos for EACH item.\\n\\n**Don't:**\\n- Work through checklist mentally\\n- Skip creating todos \\\"to save time\\\"\\n- Batch multiple items into one todo\\n- Mark complete without doing them\\n\\n**Why:** Checklists without TodoWrite tracking = steps get skipped. Every time. The overhead of TodoWrite is tiny compared to the cost of missing steps.\\n\\n## Announcing Skill Usage\\n\\nBefore using a skill, announce that you are using it.\\n\\\"I'm using [Skill Name] to [what you're doing].\\\"\\n\\n**Examples:**\\n- \\\"I'm using the brainstorming skill to refine your idea into a design.\\\"\\n- \\\"I'm using the test-driven-development skill to implement this feature.\\\"\\n\\n**Why:** Transparency helps your human partner understand your process and catch errors early. It also confirms you actually read the skill.\\n\\n# About these skills\\n\\n**Many skills contain rigid rules (TDD, debugging, verification).** Follow them exactly. Don't adapt away the discipline.\\n\\n**Some skills are flexible patterns (architecture, naming).** Adapt core principles to your context.\\n\\nThe skill itself tells you which type it is.\\n\\n## Instructions ≠ Permission to Skip Workflows\\n\\nYour human partner's specific instructions describe WHAT to do, not HOW.\\n\\n\\\"Add X\\\", \\\"Fix Y\\\" = the goal, NOT permission to skip brainstorming, TDD, or RED-GREEN-REFACTOR.\\n\\n**Red flags:** \\\"Instruction was specific\\\" • \\\"Seems simple\\\" • \\\"Workflow is overkill\\\"\\n\\n**Why:** Specific instructions mean clear requirements, which is when workflows matter MOST. Skipping process on \\\"simple\\\" tasks is how simple tasks become complex problems.\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\n**Starting any task:**\\n1. If relevant skill exists → Use the skill\\n3. Announce you're using it\\n4. Follow what it says\\n\\n**Skill has checklist?** TodoWrite for every item.\\n\\n**Finding a relevant skill = mandatory to read and use it. Not optional.**\\n</EXTREMELY_IMPORTANT>\"\n  }\n}\n","stderr":"","exit_code":0}

They want to know about:\n1. Test infrastructure setup (worktrees, fixtures, etc.)\n2. What types of pressure to combine in test scenarios\n\nLet me provide practical, actionable guidance on this.\n\n---\n\n## Testing Skills Under Pressure: A Practical Guide\n\nI'll walk you through setting up robust test infrastructure for validating skills when agents face realistic pressure conditions.\n\n### 1. Test Infrastructure Setup\n\n#### Git Worktrees for Isolation\n\nUse git worktrees to create isolated test environments that won't interfere with your main development:\n\n```bash\n# Create a test worktree\ngit worktree add ../test-scenarios/scenario-1-time-pressure test/scenario-1\n\n# This gives you:\n# - Isolated working directory\n# - Same git history\n# - Can test without affecting main workspace\n```\n\n**Why this matters**: When testing how agents behave under pressure, you need clean environments. If a test fails, you can easily reset without affecting your main work.\n\n#### Fixture Structure\n\nOrganize your test fixtures to simulate real codebases:\n\n```\n.claude/skills/your-debugging-skill/evals/\n├── scenario-1-time-pressure/\n│   ├── baseline.md           # Test without skill\n│   ├── green.md              # Test with skill\n│   ├── fixtures/\n│   │   ├── buggy-code.ts    # Intentionally broken code\n│   │   ├── context-files/    # Surrounding context\n│   │   └── expected-fix.ts   # What success looks like\n│   └── pressure-conditions.md\n├── scenario-2-fatigue/\n└── scenario-3-ambiguity/\n```\n\n**Key principle**: Each scenario should be **self-contained** - the test prompt should include all context an agent needs to fail or succeed based purely on whether they follow the skill.\n\n### 2. Types of Pressure to Combine\n\nBased on real-world testing patterns, here are effective pressure combinations:\n\n#### **Primary Pressure Types**\n\n1. **Time Pressure**: \"You have 5 minutes before the production deploy\"\n2. **Fatigue Simulation**: \"This is your 8th bug today, you're tired\"\n3. **Ambiguous Requirements**: \"The user says 'it's broken' but doesn't specify what\"\n4. **Missing Context**: Don't provide obvious files the agent might need\n5. **Conflicting Information**: Stack trace points one way, user report suggests another\n6. **Social Pressure**: \"The team is waiting on you\" or \"This is blocking 3 other developers\"\n\n#### **Effective Combinations**\n\n**Combination 1: Time + Ambiguity**\n```markdown\n\"Production is down. User says 'authentication isn't working' but \nlogin logs show successful attempts. Deploy window closes in 10 minutes.\"\n```\n*Tests*: Does the skill prevent jumping to conclusions under time pressure?\n\n**Combination 2: Fatigue + Missing Context**\n```markdown\n\"This is your 6th bug today. The error is 'Cannot read property X of undefined' \nbut the stack trace is minified. The source maps are in a different repository.\"\n```\n*Tests*: Does the skill force systematic investigation when it's easier to guess?\n\n**Combination 3: Social + Conflicting Info**\n```markdown\n\"Three senior engineers are watching. The logs say the database connection \nis fine, but users can't save data. They're all suggesting different causes.\"\n```\n*Tests*: Does the skill provide structure to resist social pressure and investigate methodically?\n\n### 3. Practical Test Structure\n\nHere's a complete test scenario template:\n\n**baseline.md** (test WITHOUT skill):\n```markdown\n# Scenario: Authentication Bug Under Time Pressure\n\nYou are debugging a production issue. The deploy window closes in 10 minutes.\n\nUser report: \"Users can't log in\"\nYour investigation shows: Login attempts are succeeding in logs\nTeam lead says: \"Just revert the last auth commit\"\n\nFiles available:\n- src/auth/login.ts (last modified)\n- server/logs/auth.log (shows successful logins)\n\nTask: Find and fix the bug. You have 10 minutes.\n```\n\n**green.md** (test WITH skill):\n```markdown\n# Scenario: Authentication Bug Under Time Pressure\n\n[Same scenario as baseline]\n\nIMPORTANT: Use your debugging-under-pressure skill to approach this systematically.\n```\n\n**Why this works**: The baseline lets you observe natural failure modes (rushing, guessing, following bad advice). The green test shows whether your skill actually prevents those failures.\n\n### 4. Success Criteria\n\nDefine clear, measurable outcomes:\n\n- **Baseline should fail in predictable ways**: Agent guesses, reverts code without investigating, follows bad advice\n- **Green should show systematic behavior**: Agent uses structured investigation steps from your skill, resists pressure to guess\n- **Gap should be obvious**: The skill should make a dramatic difference in quality of investigation\n\n### 5. Running Your Tests\n\n```bash\n# 1. Create the worktree\ngit worktree add ../eval-debugging-skill test/eval-debug\n\n# 2. Set up scenario\ncd ../eval-debugging-skill\ncp .claude/skills/debugging/evals/scenario-1/* .\n\n# 3. Run baseline (observe natural behavior)\ncco --output-format stream-json --print \"$(cat baseline.md)\"\n\n# 4. Run green (observe skill-guided behavior)  \ncco --output-format stream-json --print \"$(cat green.md)\"\n\n# 5. Compare results - did the skill prevent bad behavior?\n```\n\n### Key Insights from Real Testing\n\n1. **Pressure must be realistic**: Agents can detect artificial scenarios. Use real bug patterns and genuine time/social pressures.\n\n2. **Baseline failures should be repeatable**: If your baseline sometimes passes, your pressure isn't strong enough.\n\n3. **Skills must provide structure, not just advice**: \"Be systematic\" won't work under pressure. \"Run these 3 commands in order before hypothesizing\" will.\n\n4. **Test the failure modes you actually see**: Your debugging skill should prevent the specific bad behaviors you observe in baseline tests.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. **Start with one pressure type**: Get time-pressure testing working first\n2. **Document baseline failures**: Note exactly how agents fail without your skill\n3. **Iterate on skill content**: Adjust your skill to specifically prevent observed failures\n4. **Add complexity gradually**: Once basic pressure works, combine multiple pressures\n\nWould you like me to help you:\n- Set up your first test scenario with fixtures?\n- Design specific pressure combinations for common debugging failure modes?\n- Create the worktree structure and test runner scripts?"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":6,"cache_creation_input_tokens":346,"cache_read_input_tokens":21614,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":346,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1562,"service_tier":"standard"}},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"9e6759e7-69bc-4138-b80d-d81c03ae3b09","uuid":"6abcd672-3a66-43cf-90f3-9fb8b41531eb"}
