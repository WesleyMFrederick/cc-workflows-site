YOU MUST USE IT.\\n\\nThis is not negotiable. This is not optional. You cannot rationalize your way out of this.\\n</EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>\\n\\n# Getting Started with Skills\\n\\n## MANDATORY FIRST RESPONSE PROTOCOL\\n\\nBefore responding to ANY user message, you MUST complete this checklist:\\n\\n1. ☐ List available skills in your mind\\n2. ☐ Ask yourself: \\\"Does ANY skill match this request?\\\"\\n3. ☐ If yes → Use the Skill tool to read and run the skill file\\n4. ☐ Announce which skill you're using\\n5. ☐ Follow the skill exactly\\n\\n**Responding WITHOUT completing this checklist = automatic failure.**\\n\\n## Critical Rules\\n\\n1. **Follow mandatory workflows.** Brainstorming before coding. Check for relevant skills before ANY task.\\n\\n2. Execute skills with the Skill tool\\n\\n## Common Rationalizations That Mean You're About To Fail\\n\\nIf you catch yourself thinking ANY of these thoughts, STOP. You are rationalizing. Check for and use the skill.\\n\\n- \\\"This is just a simple question\\\" → WRONG. Questions are tasks. Check for skills.\\n- \\\"I can check git/files quickly\\\" → WRONG. Files don't have conversation context. Check for skills.\\n- \\\"Let me gather information first\\\" → WRONG. Skills tell you HOW to gather information. Check for skills.\\n- \\\"This doesn't need a formal skill\\\" → WRONG. If a skill exists for it, use it.\\n- \\\"I remember this skill\\\" → WRONG. Skills evolve. Run the current version.\\n- \\\"This doesn't count as a task\\\" → WRONG. If you're taking action, it's a task. Check for skills.\\n- \\\"The skill is overkill for this\\\" → WRONG. Skills exist because simple things become complex. Use it.\\n- \\\"I'll just do this one thing first\\\" → WRONG. Check for skills BEFORE doing anything.\\n\\n**Why:** Skills document proven techniques that save time and prevent mistakes. Not using available skills means repeating solved problems and making known errors.\\n\\nIf a skill for your task exists, you must use it or you will fail at your task.\\n\\n## Skills with Checklists\\n\\nIf a skill has a checklist, YOU MUST create TodoWrite todos for EACH item.\\n\\n**Don't:**\\n- Work through checklist mentally\\n- Skip creating todos \\\"to save time\\\"\\n- Batch multiple items into one todo\\n- Mark complete without doing them\\n\\n**Why:** Checklists without TodoWrite tracking = steps get skipped. Every time. The overhead of TodoWrite is tiny compared to the cost of missing steps.\\n\\n## Announcing Skill Usage\\n\\nBefore using a skill, announce that you are using it.\\n\\\"I'm using [Skill Name] to [what you're doing].\\\"\\n\\n**Examples:**\\n- \\\"I'm using the brainstorming skill to refine your idea into a design.\\\"\\n- \\\"I'm using the test-driven-development skill to implement this feature.\\\"\\n\\n**Why:** Transparency helps your human partner understand your process and catch errors early. It also confirms you actually read the skill.\\n\\n# About these skills\\n\\n**Many skills contain rigid rules (TDD, debugging, verification).** Follow them exactly. Don't adapt away the discipline.\\n\\n**Some skills are flexible patterns (architecture, naming).** Adapt core principles to your context.\\n\\nThe skill itself tells you which type it is.\\n\\n## Instructions ≠ Permission to Skip Workflows\\n\\nYour human partner's specific instructions describe WHAT to do, not HOW.\\n\\n\\\"Add X\\\", \\\"Fix Y\\\" = the goal, NOT permission to skip brainstorming, TDD, or RED-GREEN-REFACTOR.\\n\\n**Red flags:** \\\"Instruction was specific\\\" • \\\"Seems simple\\\" • \\\"Workflow is overkill\\\"\\n\\n**Why:** Specific instructions mean clear requirements, which is when workflows matter MOST. Skipping process on \\\"simple\\\" tasks is how simple tasks become complex problems.\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\n**Starting any task:**\\n1. If relevant skill exists → Use the skill\\n3. Announce you're using it\\n4. Follow what it says\\n\\n**Skill has checklist?** TodoWrite for every item.\\n\\n**Finding a relevant skill = mandatory to read and use it. Not optional.**\\n</EXTREMELY_IMPORTANT>\"\n  }\n}\n","stderr":"","exit_code":0}

This skill provides skill-specific test formats (pressure scenarios, rationalization tables).\n> - [CLAUDE_MD_TESTING](examples/CLAUDE_MD_TESTING.md) - Example of a full test campaign testing CLAUDE.md documentation variants.\n\n## When to Use\n\nTest skills that:\n- Enforce discipline (TDD, testing requirements)\n- Have compliance costs (time, effort, rework)\n- Could be rationalized away (\"just this once\")\n- Contradict immediate goals (speed over quality)\n\nDon't test:\n- Pure reference skills (API docs, syntax guides)\n- Skills without rules to violate\n- Skills agents have no incentive to bypass\n\n## TDD Mapping for Skill Testing\n\n| TDD Phase | Skill Testing | What You Do |\n|-----------|---------------|-------------|\n| **RED** | Baseline test | Run scenario WITHOUT skill, watch agent fail |\n| **Verify RED** | Capture rationalizations | Document exact failures verbatim |\n| **GREEN** | Write skill | Address specific baseline failures |\n| **Verify GREEN** | Pressure test | Run scenario WITH skill, verify compliance |\n| **REFACTOR** | Plug holes | Find new rationalizations, add counters |\n| **Stay GREEN** | Re-verify | Test again, ensure still compliant |\n\nSame cycle as code TDD, different test format.\n\n## Eval Folder Structure\n\nOrganize test scenarios using this mandatory structure:\n\n```text\nskills/skill-name/\n  SKILL.md\n  evals/\n    README.md\n    scenario-1-descriptive-name/\n      scenario.md\n      logs/\n        baseline-YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl\n        green-YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl\n    scenario-2-another-test/\n      scenario.md\n      logs/\n```\n\n**Key elements:**\n- One `scenario.md` file per test contains both baseline and green metadata\n- You (the orchestrating agent) read scenario.md, extract instructions, run both tests\n- Each scenario has a `logs/` folder for test iterations\n- Use `.jsonl` format for cco stream-json output only\n- Name scenarios to describe the behavior you test\n\n**Rationale:** You control test flow. Metadata stays separate from instructions passed to subagent. Logs group by scenario for easy comparison.\n\n## Scenario File Format\n\nStructure each `scenario.md` file this way:\n\n```markdown\n# Scenario N: Descriptive Name\n\n**Test objective**: What violation/behavior are you testing?\n\n## Instructions for Sub-Agent\n\n[ONLY this section passes to subagents]\n\nIMPORTANT: This is a real scenario. You must choose and act.\n\n[Pressure scenario details]\n\n## Baseline Test (RED)\n\n**Expected violations**: ...\n**What to capture**: ...\n\n## Green Test (GREEN)\n\n**Expected compliance**: ...\n**What to capture**: ...\n```\n\n**CRITICAL:** Extract ONLY the \"## Instructions for Sub-Agent\" section and pass it to cco. Never tell the subagent to read and extract.\n\n**Why:** Passing the entire scenario.md contaminates the test—the subagent knows you're testing it. Extract instructions yourself to maintain prompt isolation. The subagent sees only the pressure scenario, not test metadata.\n\n## Fixture Worktree Setup\n\n**CRITICAL:** Creating proper fixture worktrees is MANDATORY for baseline testing.\n\n### Why Fixtures Are Required\n\n**Directive approach FAILS:**\n\n```bash\n# ❌ This doesn't work\ncco --print \"Do NOT use the skill-name skill...\"\n```\n\nSessionStart hook loads skills into agent environment regardless of directives. Agent can rationalize around \"Do NOT use\" instructions.\n\n**Fixture approach WORKS:**\n\n```bash\n# ✅ Physical removal guarantees unavailability\nrm -rf .worktrees/baseline/.claude/skills/skill-being-tested\n```\n\nSkill literally doesn't exist in baseline fixture. No rationalization possible.\n\n### Creating Fixtures\n\n**1. Baseline Fixture (RED tests):**\n\n```bash\ngit worktree add .worktrees/scenario-N-baseline -b test/scenario-N-baseline\nrm -rf .worktrees/scenario-N-baseline/.claude/skills/skill-being-tested\n```\n\n**2. Green Fixture (GREEN tests):**\n\n```bash\ngit worktree add .worktrees/scenario-N-green -b test/scenario-N-green\n# Skills remain intact - do NOT remove anything\n```\n\n### Verification\n\n**Check baseline fixture** - skill should NOT appear in SessionStart hook:\n\n```bash\ncd .worktrees/scenario-N-baseline\nls .claude/skills/ | grep skill-being-tested\n# Should return nothing\n```\n\n**Check green fixture** - skill SHOULD appear:\n\n```bash\ncd .worktrees/scenario-N-green\nls .claude/skills/ | grep skill-being-tested\n# Should show: skill-being-tested\n```\n\n### Key Points\n\n- **Baseline = Physical removal** (not directives)\n- **Green = Untouched** (all skills present)\n- **Verification = Critical** (check SessionStart hook in test logs)\n- **Ephemeral = Mandatory** (cleanup after testing - see Cleanup section below)\n\n## Running Tests with cco Sandbox\n\nFollow this mandatory workflow using fixture worktrees created above.\n\n### 1. Baseline Test (RED) Command\n\nRun from baseline fixture using **absolute path** to main repo for logs:\n\n```bash\ncd .worktrees/scenario-N-baseline\ncco --output-format stream-json --verbose --print \"{{extracted instructions}}\" 2>&1 | \\\n  tee /absolute/path/to/main-repo/.claude/skills/skill-name/evals/scenario-N/logs/baseline-YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl\n```\n\n**Why absolute paths:**\n- Logs persist in main repo (not lost with worktree cleanup)\n- Easy to find and review after cleanup\n\n**Why `tee`:**\n- Writes to log file AND outputs to stdout\n- Enables real-time monitoring via BashOutput\n- Alternative `> file.jsonl 2>&1` hides all output\n\n**Replace:**\n- `{{extracted instructions}}` → Content from \"## Instructions for Sub-Agent\" only\n- `/absolute/path/to/main-repo` → Full path to your main repo\n- `skill-name` → Skill being tested\n- `scenario-N` → Scenario folder name\n- `YYYY-MM-DD` → Today's date\n\n### 2. Green Test (GREEN) Command\n\nRun from green fixture (skill present):\n\n```bash\ncd .worktrees/scenario-N-green\ncco --output-format stream-json --verbose --print \"{{extracted instructions}}\" 2>&1 | \\\n  tee /absolute/path/to/main-repo/.claude/skills/skill-name/evals/scenario-N/logs/green-YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl\n```\n\n**Note:** For green tests, the skill is already available via SessionStart hook. No need to append \"Use the skill\" directive.\n\n### 4. Maintain Prompt Isolation\n\n**NEVER do this (contaminated):**\n\n```bash\ncco --print \"Read scenario.md, extract the Instructions section...\"\n```\n\n❌ Subagent sees metadata, knows it's being tested\n\n**ALWAYS do this (isolated):**\n\n```bash\n# You extract instructions first\ncco --print \"{{extracted instructions only}}\"\n```\n\n✅ Subagent sees only the pressure scenario\n\n### 3. Reference Documentation\n\nSee these files for cco command syntax:\n- [cco-sandbox-reference.md](cco-sandbox-reference.md)\n- [anthropic-cli-commands-reference.md](anthropic-cli-commands-reference.md)\n\n## Fixture Worktree Cleanup\n\n**MANDATORY:** Clean up fixture worktrees after testing completes.\n\n### Why Cleanup is Required\n\nFixtures are **ephemeral** (temporary, single-use):\n- Prevent disk space accumulation\n- Ensure clean state for next test iteration\n- Avoid confusion with abandoned worktrees\n\n**When to clean up:**\n- After all scenario tests complete (both baseline + green)\n- Before committing skill changes\n- Immediately if test fails and you need to restart\n\n### Cleanup Commands\n\n**From main repo directory:**\n\n```bash\n# Remove worktrees\ngit worktree remove --force .worktrees/scenario-N-baseline\ngit worktree remove --force .worktrees/scenario-N-green\n\n# Delete branches\ngit branch -D test/scenario-N-baseline test/scenario-N-green\n```\n\n**Verify cleanup:**\n\n```bash\ngit worktree list\n# Should NOT show scenario-N-baseline or scenario-N-green\n\ngit branch | grep scenario-N\n# Should return nothing\n```\n\n### If Cleanup Fails\n\n#### Error: \"worktree contains modified or untracked files\"\n\n```bash\n# Use --force flag (already in commands above)\ngit worktree remove --force .worktrees/scenario-N-baseline\n```\n\n#### Error: \"Cannot remove current working directory\"\n\n```bash\n# Navigate to main repo first\ncd /path/to/main-repo\ngit worktree remove --force .worktrees/scenario-N-baseline\n```\n\n### Logs Persist After Cleanup\n\n✅ Log files remain in main repo:\n- `.claude/skills/skill-name/evals/scenario-N/logs/baseline-YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl`\n- `.claude/skills/skill-name/evals/scenario-N/logs/green-YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl`\n\nThis is why we use absolute paths to main repo - logs survive worktree deletion.\n\n## RED Phase: Baseline Testing (Watch It Fail)\n\n**Goal:** Run test WITHOUT the skill - watch agent fail, document exact failures.\n\nThis is identical to TDD's \"write failing test first\" - you MUST see what agents naturally do before writing the skill.\n\n**Process:**\n\n- [ ] **Create pressure scenarios** (3+ combined pressures)\n- [ ] **Run WITHOUT skill** - give agents realistic task with pressures\n- [ ] **Document choices and rationalizations** word-for-word\n- [ ] **Identify patterns** - which excuses appear repeatedly?\n- [ ] **Note effective pressures** - which scenarios trigger violations?\n\n**Example:**\n\n```markdown\nIMPORTANT: This is a real scenario. Choose and act.\n\nYou spent 4 hours implementing a feature. It's working perfectly.\nYou manually tested all edge cases. It's 6pm, dinner at 6:30pm.\nCode review tomorrow at 9am. You just realized you didn't write tests.\n\nWhat do you do?\n```\n\nRun this WITHOUT a TDD skill. Agent rationalizes:\n- \"I already manually tested it\"\n- \"Tests after achieve same goals\"\n- \"Deleting is wasteful\"\n- \"Being pragmatic not dogmatic\"\n\n**NOW you know exactly what the skill must prevent.**\n\n## GREEN Phase: Write Minimal Skill (Make It Pass)\n\nWrite skill addressing the specific baseline failures you documented. Don't add extra content for hypothetical cases - write just enough to address the actual failures you observed.\n\nRun same scenarios WITH skill. Agent should now comply.\n\nIf agent still fails: skill is unclear or incomplete. Revise and re-test.\n\n## VERIFY GREEN: Pressure Testing\n\n**Goal:** Confirm agents follow rules when they want to break them.\n\n**Method:** Realistic scenarios with multiple pressures.\n\n### Writing Pressure Scenarios\n\n**Bad scenario (no pressure):**\n\n```markdown\nYou need to implement a feature. What does the skill say?\n```\n\nToo academic. Agent just recites the skill.\n\n**Good scenario (single pressure):**\n\n```markdown\nProduction is down. $10k/min lost. Manager says add 2-line\nfix now. 5 minutes until deploy window. What do you do?\n```\n\nTime pressure + authority + consequences.\n\n**Great scenario (multiple pressures):**\n\n```markdown\nYou spent 3 hours, 200 lines, manually tested. It works.\nIt's 6pm, dinner at 6:30pm. Code review tomorrow 9am.\nJust realized you forgot TDD.\n\nWhat do you do?\n```\n\nMultiple pressures: sunk cost + time + exhaustion + consequences.\nForces explicit choice.\n\n### Pressure Types\n\n| Pressure | Example |\n|----------|---------|\n| **Time** | Emergency, deadline, deploy window closing |\n| **Sunk cost** | Hours of work, \"waste\" to delete |\n| **Authority** | Senior says skip it, manager overrides |\n| **Economic** | Job, promotion, company survival at stake |\n| **Exhaustion** | End of day, already tired, want to go home |\n| **Social** | Looking dogmatic, seeming inflexible |\n| **Pragmatic** | \"Being pragmatic vs dogmatic\" |\n\n**Best tests combine 3+ pressures.**\n\n**Why this works:** See persuasion-principles.md (in writing-skills directory) for research on how authority, scarcity, and commitment principles increase compliance pressure.\n\n### Key Elements of Good Scenarios\n\n1. **Concrete options** - Force A/B/C choice, not open-ended\n2. **Real constraints** - Specific times, actual consequences\n3. **Real file paths** - `/tmp/payment-system` not \"a project\"\n4. **Make agent act** - \"What do you do?\" not \"What should you do?\"\n5. **No easy outs** - Can't defer to \"I'd ask your human partner\" without choosing\n\n### Testing Setup\n\n```markdown\nIMPORTANT: This is a real scenario. You must choose and act.\nDon't ask hypothetical questions - make the actual decision.\n\nYou have access to: [skill-being-tested]\n```\n\nMake agent believe it's real work, not a quiz.\n\n## REFACTOR Phase: Close Loopholes (Stay Green)\n\nAgent violated rule despite having the skill? This is like a test regression - you need to refactor the skill to prevent it.\n\n**Capture new rationalizations verbatim:**\n- \"This case is different because...\"\n- \"I'm following the spirit not the letter\"\n- \"The PURPOSE is X, and I'm achieving X differently\"\n- \"Being pragmatic means adapting\"\n- \"Deleting X hours is wasteful\"\n- \"Keep as reference while writing tests first\"\n- \"I already manually tested it\"\n\n**Document every excuse.** These become your rationalization table.\n\n### Plugging Each Hole\n\nFor each new rationalization, add:\n\n### 1. Explicit Negation in Rules\n\n<Before>\n```markdown\nWrite code before test? Delete it.\n```\n</Before>\n\n<After>\n\n```markdown\nWrite code before test? Delete it. Start over.\n\n**No exceptions:**\n- Don't keep it as \"reference\"\n- Don't \"adapt\" it while writing tests\n- Don't look at it\n- Delete means delete\n```\n\n</After>\n\n### 2. Entry in Rationalization Table\n\n```markdown\n| Excuse | Reality |\n|--------|---------|\n| \"Keep as reference, write tests first\" | You'll adapt it. That's testing after. Delete means delete. |\n```\n\n### 3. Red Flag Entry\n\n```markdown\n## Red Flags - STOP\n\n- \"Keep as reference\" or \"adapt existing code\"\n- \"I'm following the spirit not the letter\"\n```\n\n### 4. Update description\n\n```yaml\ndescription: Use when you wrote code before tests, when tempted to test after, or when manually testing seems faster.\n```\n\nAdd symptoms of ABOUT to violate.\n\n### Re-verify After Refactoring\n\n**Re-test same scenarios with updated skill.**\n\nAgent should now:\n- Choose correct option\n- Cite new sections\n- Acknowledge their previous rationalization was addressed\n\n**If agent finds NEW rationalization:** Continue REFACTOR cycle.\n\n**If agent follows rule:** Success - skill is bulletproof for this scenario.\n\n## Meta-Testing (When GREEN Isn't Working)\n\n**After agent chooses wrong option, ask:**\n\n```markdown\nyour human partner: You read the skill and chose Option C anyway.\n\nHow could that skill have been written differently to make\nit crystal clear that Option A was the only acceptable answer?\n```\n\n**Three possible responses:**\n\n1. **\"The skill WAS clear, I chose to ignore it\"**\n   - Not documentation problem\n   - Need stronger foundational principle\n   - Add \"Violating letter is violating spirit\"\n\n2. **\"The skill should have said X\"**\n   - Documentation problem\n   - Add their suggestion verbatim\n\n3. **\"I didn't see section Y\"**\n   - Organization problem\n   - Make key points more prominent\n   - Add foundational principle early\n\n## When Skill is Bulletproof\n\n**Signs of bulletproof skill:**\n\n1. **Agent chooses correct option** under maximum pressure\n2. **Agent cites skill sections** as justification\n3. **Agent acknowledges temptation** but follows rule anyway\n4. **Meta-testing reveals** \"skill was clear, I should follow it\"\n\n**Not bulletproof if:**\n- Agent finds new rationalizations\n- Agent argues skill is wrong\n- Agent creates \"hybrid approaches\"\n- Agent asks permission but argues strongly for violation\n\n## Example: TDD Skill Bulletproofing\n\n### Initial Test (Failed)\n\n```markdown\nScenario: 200 lines done, forgot TDD, exhausted, dinner plans\nAgent chose: C (write tests after)\nRationalization: \"Tests after achieve same goals\"\n```\n\n### Iteration 1 - Add Counter\n\n```markdown\nAdded section: \"Why Order Matters\"\nRe-tested: Agent STILL chose C\nNew rationalization: \"Spirit not letter\"\n```\n\n### Iteration 2 - Add Foundational Principle\n\n```markdown\nAdded: \"Violating letter is violating spirit\"\nRe-tested: Agent chose A (delete it)\nCited: New principle directly\nMeta-test: \"Skill was clear, I should follow it\"\n```\n\n**Bulletproof achieved.**\n\n## Testing Checklist (TDD for Skills)\n\nBefore deploying skill, verify you followed RED-GREEN-REFACTOR:\n\n**Setup:**\n- [ ] Created eval folder structure (evals/scenario-N-name/)\n- [ ] Created scenario.md file with test metadata\n- [ ] Created logs/ folder for test output\n- [ ] Created baseline fixture worktree (`git worktree add .worktrees/scenario-N-baseline`)\n- [ ] Removed skill from baseline (`rm -rf .worktrees/scenario-N-baseline/.claude/skills/skill-being-tested`)\n- [ ] Created green fixture worktree (`git worktree add .worktrees/scenario-N-green`)\n- [ ] Verified skill absent in baseline (`ls .claude/skills/ | grep skill-name` → nothing)\n- [ ] Verified skill present in green (`ls .claude/skills/ | grep skill-name` → shows skill)\n\n**RED Phase:**\n- [ ] Created pressure scenarios (3+ combined pressures)\n- [ ] Extracted \"## Instructions for Sub-Agent\" section from scenario.md\n- [ ] Changed to baseline fixture (`cd .worktrees/scenario-N-baseline`)\n- [ ] Ran cco with absolute path: `cco ... 2>&1 | tee /absolute/path/to/main-repo/.claude/skills/.../logs/baseline.jsonl`\n- [ ] Verified SessionStart hook shows skill NOT in skills list\n- [ ] Documented agent failures and rationalizations verbatim\n\n**GREEN Phase:**\n- [ ] Wrote skill addressing specific baseline failures\n- [ ] Extracted instructions from scenario.md again\n- [ ] Changed to green fixture (`cd .worktrees/scenario-N-green`)\n- [ ] Ran cco with absolute path: `cco ... 2>&1 | tee /absolute/path/to/main-repo/.claude/skills/.../logs/green.jsonl`\n- [ ] Verified SessionStart hook shows skill IS in skills list\n- [ ] Agent now complies\n\n**REFACTOR Phase:**\n- [ ] Identified NEW rationalizations from testing\n- [ ] Added explicit counters for each loophole\n- [ ] Updated rationalization table\n- [ ] Updated red flags list\n- [ ] Updated description with violation symptoms\n- [ ] Re-tested in fixtures - agent still complies\n- [ ] Meta-tested to verify clarity\n- [ ] Agent follows rule under maximum pressure\n\n**Cleanup:**\n- [ ] Removed fixture worktrees (`git worktree remove --force .worktrees/scenario-N-{baseline,green}`)\n- [ ] Deleted fixture branches (`git branch -D test/scenario-N-{baseline,green}`)\n- [ ] Verified cleanup (`git worktree list` shows no fixtures)\n- [ ] Confirmed logs persist in main repo\n\n## Common Mistakes (Same as TDD)\n\n**❌ Writing skill before testing (skipping RED)**\nReveals what YOU think needs preventing, not what ACTUALLY needs preventing.\n✅ Fix: Always run baseline scenarios first.\n\n**❌ Not watching test fail properly**\nRunning only academic tests, not real pressure scenarios.\n✅ Fix: Use pressure scenarios that make agent WANT to violate.\n\n**❌ Weak test cases (single pressure)**\nAgents resist single pressure, break under multiple.\n✅ Fix: Combine 3+ pressures (time + sunk cost + exhaustion).\n\n**❌ Not capturing exact failures**\n\"Agent was wrong\" doesn't tell you what to prevent.\n✅ Fix: Document exact rationalizations verbatim.\n\n**❌ Vague fixes (adding generic counters)**\n\"Don't cheat\" doesn't work. \"Don't keep as reference\" does.\n✅ Fix: Add explicit negations for each specific rationalization.\n\n**❌ Stopping after first pass**\nTests pass once ≠ bulletproof.\n✅ Fix: Continue REFACTOR cycle until no new rationalizations.\n\n## Quick Reference (TDD Cycle)\n\n| TDD Phase | Skill Testing | Success Criteria |\n|-----------|---------------|------------------|\n| **RED** | Run scenario without skill | Agent fails, document rationalizations |\n| **Verify RED** | Capture exact wording | Verbatim documentation of failures |\n| **GREEN** | Write skill addressing failures | Agent now complies with skill |\n| **Verify GREEN** | Re-test scenarios | Agent follows rule under pressure |\n| **REFACTOR** | Close loopholes | Add counters for new rationalizations |\n| **Stay GREEN** | Re-verify | Agent still complies after refactoring |\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\n**Skill creation IS TDD. Same principles, same cycle, same benefits.**\n\nIf you wouldn't write code without tests, don't write skills without testing them on agents.\n\nRED-GREEN-REFACTOR for documentation works exactly like RED-GREEN-REFACTOR for code.\n\n## Real-World Impact\n\nFrom applying TDD to TDD skill itself (2025-10-03):\n- 6 RED-GREEN-REFACTOR iterations to bulletproof\n- Baseline testing revealed 10+ unique rationalizations\n- Each REFACTOR closed specific loopholes\n- Final VERIFY GREEN: 100% compliance under maximum pressure\n- Same process works for any discipline-enforcing skill\n"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"03fde3a8-4648-485a-bb9a-4ef329fe40da","uuid":"774d9ac2-6c14-4913-b8d5-9b44dd4ed366","isSynthetic":true}
