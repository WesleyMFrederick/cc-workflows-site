YOU MUST USE IT.\\n\\nThis is not negotiable. This is not optional. You cannot rationalize your way out of this.\\n</EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>\\n\\n# Getting Started with Skills\\n\\n## MANDATORY FIRST RESPONSE PROTOCOL\\n\\nBefore responding to ANY user message, you MUST complete this checklist:\\n\\n1. ☐ List available skills in your mind\\n2. ☐ Ask yourself: \\\"Does ANY skill match this request?\\\"\\n3. ☐ If yes → Use the Skill tool to read and run the skill file\\n4. ☐ Announce which skill you're using\\n5. ☐ Follow the skill exactly\\n\\n**Responding WITHOUT completing this checklist = automatic failure.**\\n\\n## Critical Rules\\n\\n1. **Follow mandatory workflows.** Brainstorming before coding. Check for relevant skills before ANY task.\\n\\n2. Execute skills with the Skill tool\\n\\n## Common Rationalizations That Mean You're About To Fail\\n\\nIf you catch yourself thinking ANY of these thoughts, STOP. You are rationalizing. Check for and use the skill.\\n\\n- \\\"This is just a simple question\\\" → WRONG. Questions are tasks. Check for skills.\\n- \\\"I can check git/files quickly\\\" → WRONG. Files don't have conversation context. Check for skills.\\n- \\\"Let me gather information first\\\" → WRONG. Skills tell you HOW to gather information. Check for skills.\\n- \\\"This doesn't need a formal skill\\\" → WRONG. If a skill exists for it, use it.\\n- \\\"I remember this skill\\\" → WRONG. Skills evolve. Run the current version.\\n- \\\"This doesn't count as a task\\\" → WRONG. If you're taking action, it's a task. Check for skills.\\n- \\\"The skill is overkill for this\\\" → WRONG. Skills exist because simple things become complex. Use it.\\n- \\\"I'll just do this one thing first\\\" → WRONG. Check for skills BEFORE doing anything.\\n\\n**Why:** Skills document proven techniques that save time and prevent mistakes. Not using available skills means repeating solved problems and making known errors.\\n\\nIf a skill for your task exists, you must use it or you will fail at your task.\\n\\n## Skills with Checklists\\n\\nIf a skill has a checklist, YOU MUST create TodoWrite todos for EACH item.\\n\\n**Don't:**\\n- Work through checklist mentally\\n- Skip creating todos \\\"to save time\\\"\\n- Batch multiple items into one todo\\n- Mark complete without doing them\\n\\n**Why:** Checklists without TodoWrite tracking = steps get skipped. Every time. The overhead of TodoWrite is tiny compared to the cost of missing steps.\\n\\n## Announcing Skill Usage\\n\\nBefore using a skill, announce that you are using it.\\n\\\"I'm using [Skill Name] to [what you're doing].\\\"\\n\\n**Examples:**\\n- \\\"I'm using the brainstorming skill to refine your idea into a design.\\\"\\n- \\\"I'm using the test-driven-development skill to implement this feature.\\\"\\n\\n**Why:** Transparency helps your human partner understand your process and catch errors early. It also confirms you actually read the skill.\\n\\n# About these skills\\n\\n**Many skills contain rigid rules (TDD, debugging, verification).** Follow them exactly. Don't adapt away the discipline.\\n\\n**Some skills are flexible patterns (architecture, naming).** Adapt core principles to your context.\\n\\nThe skill itself tells you which type it is.\\n\\n## Instructions ≠ Permission to Skip Workflows\\n\\nYour human partner's specific instructions describe WHAT to do, not HOW.\\n\\n\\\"Add X\\\", \\\"Fix Y\\\" = the goal, NOT permission to skip brainstorming, TDD, or RED-GREEN-REFACTOR.\\n\\n**Red flags:** \\\"Instruction was specific\\\" • \\\"Seems simple\\\" • \\\"Workflow is overkill\\\"\\n\\n**Why:** Specific instructions mean clear requirements, which is when workflows matter MOST. Skipping process on \\\"simple\\\" tasks is how simple tasks become complex problems.\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\n**Starting any task:**\\n1. If relevant skill exists → Use the skill\\n3. Announce you're using it\\n4. Follow what it says\\n\\n**Skill has checklist?** TodoWrite for every item.\\n\\n**Finding a relevant skill = mandatory to read and use it. Not optional.**\\n</EXTREMELY_IMPORTANT>\"\n  }\n}\n","stderr":"","exit_code":0}
