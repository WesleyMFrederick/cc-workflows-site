YOU MUST USE IT.\\n\\nThis is not negotiable. This is not optional. You cannot rationalize your way out of this.\\n</EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>\\n\\n# Getting Started with Skills\\n\\n## MANDATORY FIRST RESPONSE PROTOCOL\\n\\nBefore responding to ANY user message, you MUST complete this checklist:\\n\\n1. ☐ List available skills in your mind\\n2. ☐ Ask yourself: \\\"Does ANY skill match this request?\\\"\\n3. ☐ If yes → Use the Skill tool to read and run the skill file\\n4. ☐ Announce which skill you're using\\n5. ☐ Follow the skill exactly\\n\\n**Responding WITHOUT completing this checklist = automatic failure.**\\n\\n## Critical Rules\\n\\n1. **Follow mandatory workflows.** Brainstorming before coding. Check for relevant skills before ANY task.\\n\\n2. Execute skills with the Skill tool\\n\\n## Common Rationalizations That Mean You're About To Fail\\n\\nIf you catch yourself thinking ANY of these thoughts, STOP. You are rationalizing. Check for and use the skill.\\n\\n- \\\"This is just a simple question\\\" → WRONG. Questions are tasks. Check for skills.\\n- \\\"I can check git/files quickly\\\" → WRONG. Files don't have conversation context. Check for skills.\\n- \\\"Let me gather information first\\\" → WRONG. Skills tell you HOW to gather information. Check for skills.\\n- \\\"This doesn't need a formal skill\\\" → WRONG. If a skill exists for it, use it.\\n- \\\"I remember this skill\\\" → WRONG. Skills evolve. Run the current version.\\n- \\\"This doesn't count as a task\\\" → WRONG. If you're taking action, it's a task. Check for skills.\\n- \\\"The skill is overkill for this\\\" → WRONG. Skills exist because simple things become complex. Use it.\\n- \\\"I'll just do this one thing first\\\" → WRONG. Check for skills BEFORE doing anything.\\n\\n**Why:** Skills document proven techniques that save time and prevent mistakes. Not using available skills means repeating solved problems and making known errors.\\n\\nIf a skill for your task exists, you must use it or you will fail at your task.\\n\\n## Skills with Checklists\\n\\nIf a skill has a checklist, YOU MUST create TodoWrite todos for EACH item.\\n\\n**Don't:**\\n- Work through checklist mentally\\n- Skip creating todos \\\"to save time\\\"\\n- Batch multiple items into one todo\\n- Mark complete without doing them\\n\\n**Why:** Checklists without TodoWrite tracking = steps get skipped. Every time. The overhead of TodoWrite is tiny compared to the cost of missing steps.\\n\\n## Announcing Skill Usage\\n\\nBefore using a skill, announce that you are using it.\\n\\\"I'm using [Skill Name] to [what you're doing].\\\"\\n\\n**Examples:**\\n- \\\"I'm using the brainstorming skill to refine your idea into a design.\\\"\\n- \\\"I'm using the test-driven-development skill to implement this feature.\\\"\\n\\n**Why:** Transparency helps your human partner understand your process and catch errors early. It also confirms you actually read the skill.\\n\\n# About these skills\\n\\n**Many skills contain rigid rules (TDD, debugging, verification).** Follow them exactly. Don't adapt away the discipline.\\n\\n**Some skills are flexible patterns (architecture, naming).** Adapt core principles to your context.\\n\\nThe skill itself tells you which type it is.\\n\\n## Instructions ≠ Permission to Skip Workflows\\n\\nYour human partner's specific instructions describe WHAT to do, not HOW.\\n\\n\\\"Add X\\\", \\\"Fix Y\\\" = the goal, NOT permission to skip brainstorming, TDD, or RED-GREEN-REFACTOR.\\n\\n**Red flags:** \\\"Instruction was specific\\\" • \\\"Seems simple\\\" • \\\"Workflow is overkill\\\"\\n\\n**Why:** Specific instructions mean clear requirements, which is when workflows matter MOST. Skipping process on \\\"simple\\\" tasks is how simple tasks become complex problems.\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\n**Starting any task:**\\n1. If relevant skill exists → Use the skill\\n3. Announce you're using it\\n4. Follow what it says\\n\\n**Skill has checklist?** TodoWrite for every item.\\n\\n**Finding a relevant skill = mandatory to read and use it. Not optional.**\\n</EXTREMELY_IMPORTANT>\"\n  }\n}\n","stderr":"","exit_code":0}

Problem is after.\n\n  const step2 = doStep2(step1);\n  expect(step2).toBeDefined(); // Test fails here? Problem is step2.\n\n  const result = doStep3(step2);\n  expect(result).toBe(expected);\n});\n```\n\n### Async/Promise Debugging\n\n**Missing `await`** (most common):\n```typescript\n// BAD - test passes but shouldn't\ntest('saves data', () => {\n  saveData({ name: 'test' }); // Missing await!\n  const data = loadData();\n  expect(data.name).toBe('test'); // False positive\n});\n\n// GOOD\ntest('saves data', async () => {\n  await saveData({ name: 'test' });\n  const data = await loadData();\n  expect(data.name).toBe('test');\n});\n```\n\n**Unhandled promise rejection**:\n```typescript\n// Check test output for unhandled rejections\n// Add .catch() to promises for debugging:\nawait somePromise().catch(err => {\n  console.log('Promise rejected:', err);\n  throw err;\n});\n```\n\n### Mock/Stub Issues\n\n**Mock not called**:\n```typescript\n// Verify mock was actually used\ntest('calls dependency', () => {\n  const mockDep = vi.fn();\n  doSomething(mockDep);\n\n  console.log('Mock called:', mockDep.mock.calls.length);\n  console.log('Mock calls:', mockDep.mock.calls);\n\n  expect(mockDep).toHaveBeenCalled();\n});\n```\n\n**Mock returns wrong value**:\n```typescript\n// Verify mock setup\nconst mockFn = vi.fn().mockReturnValue('expected');\nconsole.log('Mock will return:', mockFn());\n```\n\n### Environment Issues\n\n**Check test environment**:\n```typescript\ntest('environment debug', () => {\n  console.log('NODE_ENV:', process.env.NODE_ENV);\n  console.log('CWD:', process.cwd());\n  console.log('Test file:', __filename);\n});\n```\n\n### When Debugging Takes > 15 Minutes\n\n**STOP. Something is wrong beyond the test:**\n\n1. **Test design issue**: Test too complex? Split into smaller tests.\n2. **Code design issue**: Hard to test = hard to use. Simplify interface.\n3. **Wrong approach**: Are you testing implementation details? Test behavior instead.\n4. **Missing knowledge**: Ask your human partner.\n\n### Debug Checklist\n\nBefore asking for help, verify:\n\n- [ ] Test runs in isolation (no dependency on other tests)\n- [ ] All async operations have `await`\n- [ ] All promises have error handling\n- [ ] Test name accurately describes what it tests\n- [ ] Assertions match data types (`.toBe()` vs `.toEqual()`)\n- [ ] Mocks are actually called and return expected values\n- [ ] Test data is set up correctly\n- [ ] Environment variables are set if needed\n\n### Quick Wins\n\n**Most test failures are caused by:**\n1. Missing `await` (40%)\n2. Wrong assertion type `.toBe()` vs `.toEqual()` (25%)\n3. Undefined data from setup (20%)\n4. Test order dependencies (10%)\n5. Everything else (5%)\n\n**Check these first before deep debugging.**\n\n## Debugging Integration\n\nBug found? Write failing test reproducing it. Follow TDD cycle.
